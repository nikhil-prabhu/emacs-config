* emacs-config
  
  My personal configuration files for GNU Emacs.

* About
  
  This repository contains two main files: one Elisp file (~.emacs~) that behaves as a Bootstrapper with some init code, and one Org file (~.config.org~) that consists of all the custom settings and configuration.
  
  This configuration is free to use, modify and/or redistribute under the terms mentioned in the GNU General Public License v2.0.
  
  *NOTE:* 
  - I primarily use UNIX based operating systems (GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, etc.) for my work. So while this configuration may also work on Windows, I can't guarantee it.
  - This configuration is optimized for GNU Emacs version 26.x and above. It may not work with versions older than 24.x.

* Installation
  
  - Clone this repository to a directory on your local machine.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ git clone https://github.com/nikhil-prabhu/emacs-config
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  - Copy and paste the ~.emacs~ and ~.config.org~ files in your home folder.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ cp emacs-config/.emacs emacs-config/.config.org ~/
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  
  - Now start up GNU Emacs and wait for the required packages to be automatically installed (you may be prompted to answer 'y' or 'n' at certain stages). Once installation has finished, you may have a **Warnings** buffer show up, which you can ignore. Finally, type:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x <RET> all-the-icons-install-fonts <RET>
  #+END_EXAMPLE
  
  - This will install all the necessary icon fonts (on Windows, you'll have to manually install these fonts once they're downloaded).
